In next chapters, more advanced control techniques will be treated. All of them are based on the state-space realization of the system, so a reconstruction of the state is needed since some signals are not available because too noisy to be used (i.e. motor and masses speed, derived by potentiometer and encoders position readings).

\section{State observer}

The gray-box models, identified in \cref{sec:gray_b_id}, are sufficiently precise to be used for observers design. The state reconstruction is performed by using motor and masses position signals; poles of the closed-loop observer are placed in a prescribed position: they must be sufficiently far from the imaginary axis so that asymptotic stability is ensured~(even considering poles uncertainty) and, moreover, time settlement of the observer is satisfactorily low.

\paragraph{\onedof\ system}

In order to construct the observer, matrices A and C are needed~(where C matrix identifies the available signals, paying attention to those sign). In case of \onedof\ system:

\begin{equation}
	A = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 &1 & 0 & 0 \\
		-\frac{K_{s_1}}{J_m} & -\frac{B_m}{J_m}-\frac{\eta_m \eta_g k_t k_m {K_g}^2}{R_m J_m}  & \frac{K_{s_1}}{J_m} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		\frac{K_{s_1}}{J_1} & 0 & -\frac{K_{s_1}}{J_1} & -\frac{B_1}{J_1}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\qquad
	C =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
\label{eqn:1dof_mat_obs}
\end{equation}

Closed-loop poles can be automatically placed in prescribed positions thanks to the MATLAB function~\textit{place}\footnote{This function requires to locate poles in different positions. To place poles in a unique position, it is sufficient to slightly move some of them.}.
The choice for poles frequency is~$400\, rad/s$, meaning that the settling time of the observer is about 12.5 ms. Indeed, it has been selected to be very fast because the model is very reliable; actually, no further tuning has been done on this observer, since its aim was just to test its functioning with a simple state-space controller (pole placement, explained later on). However, this was a first step for the development of a more advanced re-constructor, i.e., the Kalman filter.

The estimated state dynamics, then, becomes
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\hat{x}}(t) = A\hat{x}(t) + Bu(t) + L [y(t) - C\hat{x}(t) - Du(t)] = (A-LC)\hat{x}(t) + (B-LD)u(t) + Ly(t)
	\label{eqn:est_state_dyn}
\end{equation}
and its estimation error dynamics is asymptotically stable, as pole placement prescribed:
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\hat{e}} (t) = (A-LC) \hat{e} (t)
\end{equation}

The necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee observer design and asymptotic stability is that pair~$(A,C)$ is observable. In this case, the rank of observability matrix is 4~(as the order of the system). \\
In order to avoid the initial settlement of the observer, 
The initial position of the system, detected by the potentiometer, is subtracted to all position readings~(motor, first mass and, if connected, second mass)\footnote{Encoders return just a position relative to their initial state, which is reset to zero at the beginning of each experiment. Therefore, in our model conditioning, the absolute position of encoders is obtained by adding the initial reading of the potentiometer. In conclusion, the observer needs to subtract the initial position to all sensors, both potentiometer and encoders.}; this causes a shift in state reconstruction that will never be recovered. Actually, this does not represent a problem, since this kind of observer is only used for pole-placement controllers: as shown later, this will automatically bring the system to the correct reference thanks to an integral action.\footnote{Just for graphical reasons, reconstructed and real states are superimposed by adding again the initial condition to~$\hat x$.}
%The measurements are returned as an absolute displacement with respect to the potentiometer reference. Thus, the observers have to recover the initial condition that is the starting position. Since this is measurable, it is removed so that the observer doesn't have the superimposition of the free response due to the initial condition.

\subparagraph{Experiment results}
In \cref{fig:observer_1dof}, a position control (performed by pole-placement, introduced in next chapter) is reported. 
Concerning the speeds, mass velocity is a bit different from the measured one~(derived by the encoder). Because of the significant noise on potentiometer measurements and since observer poles are extremely fast, the reconstruction tries to follow the oscillating measurement; this results in a huge variance on the motor speed estimation. \\
In any case, small differences on speed are not critical, since speed signals are not significantly weighted in the following control techniques.

\paragraph{\twodof\ system}

Actually, the \twodof\ observer structure is very similar to the previous one; matrices dimensions and available signals are different: in this case, in addition to potentiometer and first mass encoder, also the second mass position is available thanks to the last encoder. This means that matrix C has one more row:
\begin{equation}
	A = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 &1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		-\frac{K_{s_1}}{J_m} & -\frac{B_m}{J_m}-\frac{\eta_m \eta_g k_t k_m {K_g}^2}{R_m J_m}  & \frac{K_{s_1}}{J_m} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		\frac{K_{s_1}}{J_1} & 0 & -\frac{K_{s_1}+K_{s_2}}{J_1} & -\frac{B_1}{J_1} & \frac{K_{s_2}}{J_1} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 0 & \frac{K_{s_2}}{J_2} & 0 & -\frac{K_{s_2}}{J_2} & -\frac{B_2}{J_2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	C =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
\label{eqn:2dof_mat_obs}
\end{equation}

This time, poles have been located in different positions: 2 of them in~$-300 \, rad/s$ and the other 4 in~$-400 \, rad/s$. Also in this case, $\mathit{O}$ matrix of the pair~$(A,C)$ is full rank. As in the~\onedof\ case, a comparison between measured and reconstructed signals (figure~\ref{fig:observer_2dof}) shows that positions are very precisely estimated, while speeds are noisy and shifted in time.

\section{Kalman filter}
\label{sec:Kalman_filter}
The state reconstruction based on Luenberg observer works fine in absence of any disturbance. Unfortunately, as mentioned in \cref{sec:sensors}, sensors produce signals at each sampling time that can be considered as stochastic variables. These variables have a variance that depends on the intrinsic characteristic of the sensors. The solution to represent this kind of behavior, consist in separating the measurement signal $y(t)$ in a component deriving from the states, that can be considered the real value, and a component due to a white noise with a given covariance.  \\

With a mathematical description 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		\dot x(t) =\ A x(t) + B u(t) +n_x(t) \\
		y(t) =\ C x(t) + D u(t) + n_y(t)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are independent zero-mean white Gaussian processes having covariances
\begin{center}
	$E[n_x(t)n_x'(t)]=Q_x \delta(t-s)$  and $E[n_y(t)n_y'(t)]=Q_y \delta(t-s) $
\end{center}
for some $Q_x = Q_x' \geq 0$ and $Q_y = Q_y' > 0$, where $E[v]$ denotes the expected value of a random variable $v$.\\

The stationary version of the Kalman filtering problem can be posed as the task of generating a reconstruction $\hat x (t)$ of the state vector $x(t)$ using measurement $y(t)$ that minimize 
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{t \to \infty }E[ ||x(t) - \hat x(t) ||^2 ]
\end{equation}
which is the steady state variance of the reconstruction error $ x-\hat x$.\\

Although the original estimation problem didn't take in account any measured input $u$, in presence of it, it is possible to slightly modify the equations for the estimation. 
The estimated state dynamics is a stable and causal LTI system, with equation as \cref{eqn:est_state_dyn}. \\
The $L$ gain is the result of the filtering problem, for the generalized plant, without input $u$.
To obtain it, exogenous input $w$, that is any zero-mean unit-intensity white process such that
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		n_x(t) \\
		n_y(t)
	\end{bmatrix} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		B_wB_w'& B_wD_w'\\
		D_wB_w' & D_wD_w'
	\end{bmatrix} w(t)
\end{equation}
is defined. \\

Under the assumption that noises $n_x$ and $n_y$ are uncorrelated, i.e. $B_wD_w' = 0$, the $L$ matrix is obtained solving a Riccati equation, involving also the other system matrices, that is
\begin{equation}
	Y = AYA' + B_wB_w' + (AYC'+B_wD_w')(CYC'+D_wD_w')^{-1}(CYA'+D_wB_w')
	\label{eqn:riccati_kf}
\end{equation}
where $Y = Y' \geq 0$.\\
Then, 
\begin{equation}
	L = (AYC'+B_wD_w')(CYC'+D_wD_w')^{-1}
	\label{eqn:kf_gain}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Full sensors use}
Given the above definition of the problem, the \onedof. and the \twodof\ systems generate similar solutions and make use of the same matrices as in \cref{eqn:1dof_mat_obs} and \cref{eqn:2dof_mat_obs}.
The $Q_y$ matrix is defined based on the variances computed at \cref{sec:sensors} and it is kept constant through all the development of this tool. 
On the other hand, matrix $Q_x$ doesn't depend directly on some physical properties and can be used to tune the filter. 
This means that by varying the parameters in this matrix, the solutions of the filtering problem change. \\
Moreover, this matrix can be considered as the uncertainty derived from the model identification process, i.e. since matrices $A$ and $B$ of the system have been computed by grey-box estimation (\cref{sec:gray_b_id}), they are naturally uncertain as they can't capture the real dynamic of the system that is much more complicated. \\

The obtained model can simulate much better the position of the masses then that of the motor shaft, this because during the identification process those measurements where taken with the encoder, that is much more accurate than the potentiometer. This translates in a higher value of variance for the first state, that is the position of the shaft, with respect to the other position state. With a similar reasoning, speed states are more uncertain then position ones, as they are derived from them. Trying to balance the filter reliability (keeping $Q_x$ as high as possible) and filter settling time (keeping $Q_x$ as low as possible) these are the matrices that better suit the filtering problem.
\begin{equation}
	B_w = \begin{bmatrix}
		\sqrt{0.3e-4} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & \sqrt{1e-2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & \sqrt{1e-8} & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{1e-4} & 0 & 0
	\end{bmatrix} \
	D_w = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{1e-6} & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2e-8} 
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\label{eqn:b_w_d_w}
\end{equation}
For the \twodof\ system the matrices have the same values, but their size is extended.\\
The results of \cref{eqn:riccati_kf} and \cref{eqn:kf_gain} place the poles of the filters in positions where the dominant time constants are around $0.02\ s$, that is fast enough for our settling time goals. \\

From an analysis of the reconstructed states, it emerges that indeed these are less sensitive to measurement noise then the observers solution. This reflects in improved control signals when state feedback control law are used. \\

Moreover, while the characteristic of the encoder, that is a direct measurement coming from a digital sensor, it is constant through the whole revolution, the one from the potentiometer, that is an indirect measurement from an analog sensor, it is less reliable and limited to some range. 
\begin{figure*}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{kf reconstruction 2dof.png}
	\caption{Kalman filter reconstruction compared with available measurements}
	\label{fig:kf_2dof}
\end{figure*}
In \cref{fig:kf_2dof} it is possible to see how, despite a drift in the potentiometer measurement around the second step, the reconstructed state is more related to the measurement coming from the encoders than that of the potentiometer. Indeed, the dashed lines (the reconstructed signals) are very close to the signals coming from the encoders (red and green continuous lines), despite the fact that the measurement coming from the potentiometer reaches a different steady state value (continuous blue line). This error in the potentiometer measurement can be the result of a small non linearity in the characteristic of the sensor. \\

This example shows perfectly the reliability of the Kalman filter; the noise variance of the shaft measurement is 50 times bigger than that of the encoders, the solution obtained with this formulation of the problem filters the noise in the optimal way. Moreover, in this specific situation, Kalman filter makes the measurement less reliable (in this case the potentiometer) almost useless, trusting only the best ones, i.e., the one deriving from the encoder. 

\paragraph{Faulty sensor estimation}
The setup that has been used up to this point has been making use of all  the possible measurements, but after the analysis of the reconstructed state with the Kalman filter there was still a point to be analyzed. What would be the performance and the reliability of the system in case the encoder, that is the most important measurement, doesn't work anymore. \\
This actually happened for real during some laboratory experiment; the encoder from the second mass disconnected from the shaft and couldn't produce any results for some time. \\ 

Thus, for both systems, different state re-constructors have been developed, always based on Kalman filtering and using different combinations of the available sensors. \\
The element that change in the design of the different filters are the matrices $C$ and $D_w$. Based on the combination of sensors, different rows of the original $C$ and $D_w$ matrices are selected. \\
From a first analysis, all the possible setups produce an observable system, thus, applying Kalman filter with the minimum number of sensor is possible in every configuration. \\

The results that are produced from these configurations can be summarized in two types. \\ 

The first can be called encoder based solution, this means that even if the measurement from the potentiometer is available, it is almost automatically discarded in favor of the encoder one. As previously mentioned, this happens because the potentiometer variance is much bigger then that one of the encoder and Riccati equations produce results that depends mostly on the lowest one. All the solutions where at least one encoder is used, produce this result and generate a state estimator with a time constant very low, allowing to push the control action to high speeds.\\

On the other hand, the solution that makes use of only the potentiometer, both in \onedof\ and \twodof, generates a different type of filter. When only the potentiometer is used, the system matrices for the output equation (example is based on \twodof) becomes 
\begin{equation}
	C = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
	\end{bmatrix} \
	D_w = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{1e-6} & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}
The Riccati equation that solves the filtering problem for this system produce much slower re-constructors. The time constant of the produced filter is around~$0.8\ s$. Changing the parameters in the matrix $Q_x$ allows to steer a little bit the position of the poles of the estimator, but it can't move a lot the time constant of the main dynamic, mainly its damping. Indeed, the matrix $B_w$ at \ref{eqn:b_w_d_w} has been selected with those values because it was the one generating the less oscillatory response of the filter for this setup and a fast enough estimation for the other ones.\\

In order to be able to use also this setup the control action needs to be slowed down, otherwise different controllers should be tuned based on the availability of the sensors and logic switches could select the more appropriate controller. \\

Some tests with a switch that selects the different state re-constructors have been performed. The results are not satisfying. In the \onedof\ setup, when the controller passes from the Kalman filter with all the sensors to the one with only the encoder, this isn't a problem and the system keeps following the reference, but when it starts to use the estimation derived only by the potentiometer, it diverges. This diverging behavior is not caused by an unstable mode of the controller, but it is due to a couple of reasons. When the controller is switched the estimation changes instantaneously and so does the control action. When the two estimates are quite closed, like between the classic filter and the one with only the encoder, this sudden change results in a very small step in the voltage applied. Instead, when the estimations differ a lot, this voltage step may be too big and the saturation block limits the control action. This triggers an unstable effect, with the voltage being applied continuously at the two saturation limits. The controller is unable to revert this, trying to apply bigger and bigger control actions to bring the state back to reference, but being limited by the saturation block. To avoid this effect, that couldn't be compensated in an easy way, the observers have been tested one at the time. \\

The results confirm partially the hypothesis, the filters with at least one encoder for the \onedof\ and at least~2 sensors for the \twodof\ system works well and can use the fastest controller.\\
Moreover, the \onedof\ system can be controlled estimating the states from only the potentiometer measurement, but with the condition of slowing down the controller.\\

\subparagraph{Potentiometer only in \twodof\ case}
On the other hand, for the \twodof\ setup it was not possible to control it using only the potentiometer. \\
A first hypothesis is in the observability matrix. This is full rank for all the possible combination of used measurements. In case of potentiometer sensor only, the smallest singular value obtained by~\textit{svd} is around~$0.5$ and the condition number is around~$1e+8$, then it is possible to exclude numerical errors in the rank calculation of matrix~$M_O$. On the other hand, the modal matrix computed by MATLAB function \textit{eig} is not full rank; this lead us to a wrong conclusion, in fact, actually the system seems to be observable: in every transfer function all poles appear from input to any output. Moreover, this Kalman filter has been tested on past experiments; results contain speeds oscillations at~$62.3\ rad/s$. \\
A deeper analysis, indeed, shows that some poles of the Kalman filter with potentiometer only are in the same position of the system ones. In particular, there are two couples of complex conjugate poles at~$24.9\ rad/s$ and~$62.3\ rad/s$ (the same of the system). \\

\label{SVD_explaination}
\par Since the controller is based on that reconstruction, it applies a control action exactly at the system resonance frequency. Hence, reconstructing and applying the control action at the system resonance frequency, together with the high noise of the potentiometer, would cause a dynamical instability.
